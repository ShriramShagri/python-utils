    Transform a method of a class into a property whose value is computed once and then cached as a normal attribute 
    for the life of the instance. Similar to property(), with the addition of caching. Useful for expensive computed 
    properties of instances that are otherwise effectively immutable.

        The mechanics of cached_property() are somewhat different from property(). A regular property blocks attribute 
        writes unless a setter is defined. In contrast, a cached_property allows writes.

        The cached_property decorator only runs on lookups and only when an attribute of the same name doesnâ€™t exist. 
        When it does run, the cached_property writes to the attribute with the same name. Subsequent attribute reads 
        and writes take precedence over the cached_property method and it works like a normal attribute.

        The cached value can be cleared by deleting the attribute. This allows the cached_property method to run again.
